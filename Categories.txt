I'm thinking that some things will be needed for RL implementation. Like an app that you can set the mechanics for a 'rolled' character within. That way when I go to test these different dimensions I can keep track of the 'physics'. 

Otherwise. Some Extensions ( Unity specific ) , and other tools that are platform/framework agnostic but in the mindset of Unity/Games would be good here.. 

Now I just have to get them out of that binder....
